<h1>PURPOSE</h1>
This is a fully responsive Credit Card website built using React. As a front-end developer, I created this project to apply React concepts including React Router, component-based architecture, and responsive design. The site features a clean UI with no backend—purely front-end.

<h1>FEATURES</h1>
- **AI Assistant** — Chatbot to answer questions about cards, memberships, and features
<br>
- **Animations** — Smooth fade-in, slide effects, and hover interactions
<br>
- **Light Peaceful Blue Theme** — White, blue, grey, and yellow color palette
<br>
- **Fully Responsive** — Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop

<h1>HOW IT'S MADE</h1>
- React & React Router
<br>
- Vite for build tooling
<br>
- FontAwesome for icons
<br>
- CSS animations and transitions
<br>
- Dribbble inspiration (Satria Nayottama Capital Finance app Landing Page)

<h1>LESSONS LEARNED</h1>
- Using data files to render card info dynamically
<br>
- Index as prop for conditional styling (even/odd layout)
<br>
- Redirect file in public folder for Netlify/SPA hosting
<br>
- React Router uses Link instead of anchor tags
<br>
- CSS variables for consistent theming

<h1>FUTURE OPTIMIZATIONS</h1>
- Sign-in functionality and user dashboard
<br>
- Apply now page with input fields
<br>
- Application approval/rejection flow
<br>
- Backend integration for form submissions
